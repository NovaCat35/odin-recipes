    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite instant comfort foods is 拌面 (ban mian, meaning “tossed noodles”), 
        a completely underappreciated and little-known street food from Fujian province. 
        Ban mian is a totally generic term, and googling it yields a wide variety of noodle dishes. 
        The Fujianese variant, however, is perhaps the most amenable to Americans: it involves peanut butter! And it takes about as much time to cook as instant ramen.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut butter</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>Sugar, to taste</li>
        <li>2 (4 ounce) servings of wonton noodles or you noodles of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add noodles and cook according to package instructions</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together peanut butter, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil and sugar</li>
            <li>Once the noodles are cooked through, reserve 1/2 cup of the starchy water and add the drained cooked noodles to the bowl with the prepared sauce</li>
            <li>Toss to combine and use the starchy water to adjust the consistency</li>
            <li>Garnish with scallions, sesame seeds or chili oil</li>
        </ol>
