    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Tenshinhan (天津飯) is a Chinese-influenced Japanese dish. 
        The fluffy omelette with crab meat is placed on a mound of rice and the thick sauce poured over the omelette is so flavoursome. 
        Crab Omelette on Rice is very easy to make.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 serving of rice</li>
        <h3>Omelette with Cooked Crab Meat</h3>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>40g/ 1.4oz crab meat/kanikama</li>
        <li>1 tbsp shallots/scallion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        <h3>Tenshinhan Sauce (Sweet Savoury)</h3>
        <li>80ml / 2.7oz water</li>
        <li>½ tsp chicken stock powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp cooking sake</li>
        <li>1¼ tsp cornflour/corn starch</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Set up</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put all the Tenshinhan Sauce ingredients (whichever sauce you pick) in a small saucepan, mix well and bring it to a boil.</li>
            <li>The sauce initially looks whitish but as the sauce is heated up and thickens, it becomes clear dark brown. Turn the heat off and leave until required.</li>
            <li>If the rice is not hot, warm it up in microwave. Heat up a hot bowl of rice and put it in the centre of a serving bowl</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Making Omelette with Cooked Crab Meat</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat two eggs lightly in a bowl, add the crab meat, shallots and a tiny pinch of salt. Mix. </li>
            <li>Add oil to a small frying pan and heat it over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Using a fork or cooking chopsticks, mix the egg mixture in a swirling motion, from outside to inside</li>
            <li>When the egg is half cooked (it does not take long to get to this stage) and the surface is still a bit wet, turn the heat off.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Making Omelette with Kanikama Crab Sticks</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat two eggs lightly in a bowl with a tiny pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Add oil to a small frying pan (I used 20cm / 8” pan, note 5) and heat it over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger and the shredded kanikama, stir-fry for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour the egg mixture into the pan. The mixture starts setting on the outside immediately.</li>
            <li>Using a fork or cooking chopsticks, mix the egg mixture and kanikama pieces in a swirling motion, from outside to inside</li>
            <li>When the egg is half cooked (it does not take long to get to this stage) and the surface is still a bit wet, turn the heat off.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Serving</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Transfer the egg from the frying pan onto the rice and cover all of the rice with the egg. It works best if you tilt the pan and slide the egg from the pan to the rice. You may need to use a spatula to assist.</li>
            <li>Bring the Tenshinhan Sauce to a boil if it is not hot. Pour the sauce over the egg. If using green peas, sprinkle them over the top.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
